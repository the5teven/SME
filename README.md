# Simulated Method of Embeddings (SME)

This repository contains a preliminary presentation of the Simulated Method of Embeddings (SME), a contrastive learning-based approach to structural estimation in economics. The method does not require likelihood functions or moment conditions and builds on recent advances in representation learning.

This draft outlines:
- The SME estimator formulation
- InfoNCE-based contrastive loss
- Theoretical guarantees (KL divergence minimization, consistency)
- Simulation results comparing SME to standard estimators
